# üïµÔ∏è Beast Visitor Tracker Bundle

A modern, developer-friendly, privacy-aware Symfony bundle for tracking, analyzing, and auditing traffic to your app or site ‚Äî with zero JavaScript, no cookies, and full CLI access.

> Built for privacy-first analytics, sysadmin diagnostics, devops monitoring, and marketing insights ‚Äî from a single log source.
>
> Note: This tool is not designed to replace Google Analytics or enterprise-grade analytics suites. It shines in the early stages of development, during MVP testing, or in debugging phases where performance insights, traffic logs, and CLI-driven analytics are more valuable than dashboards. It prioritizes simplicity, speed, and visibility for developers and teams.

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
composer require beast/visitor-tracker-bundle
```

If you're not using Symfony Flex, manually register the bundle:

```php
// config/bundles.php
return [
    Beast\VisitorTrackerBundle\BeastVisitorTrackerBundle::class => ['all' => true],
];
```

```yaml
// config/packages/beast_visitor_tracker.yaml
beast_visitor_tracker:
  geo_enabled: false         # Disable geo API calls for privacy
  ip_anonymize: true         # Mask last part of IP address
  log_dir: '%kernel.project_dir%/var/visitor_tracker/logs'
```

## üß† How It Works

Every main request triggers the logger:

```php
Beast\VisitorTrackerBundle\EventSubscriber\VisitorLoggerSubscriber
```

...and at termination, enriches the last matching log entry with:

* request duration
* memory usage
* HTTP status
* route name
* content type
* authentication status

Log entries are stored per day:

```bash
var/visitor_tracker/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.log
```

Example entry:

```json
{
    "date": "2025-07-27 11:31:25",
    "ip": "127.0.0.1",
    "uri": "\/serial-number?utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=summer",
    "method": "GET",
    "user_agent": "Mozilla\/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/136.0.0.0 Safari\/537.36",
    "visitor_id": "574136fe4bbfcbdf48c98e38e50604cbd448e9d9",
    "referrer": null,
    "referrer_domain": null,
    "referrer_path": null,
    "country": "unknown",
    "city": null,
    "isp": null,
    "browser": "Chrome",
    "os": "Linux",
    "device": "desktop",
    "is_bot": false,
    "utm": {
        "utm_source": "facebook",
        "utm_campaign": "summer"
    },
    "locale": "en-US",
    "duration_ms": 21.02,
    "status_code": 200,
    "route": "app_serialnumber_index",
    "memory_usage_bytes": 4194304,
    "auth": "anon",
    "content_type": "text\/html; charset=UTF-8",
    "response_size_bytes": 45423,
    "php_warnings": {
        "notice": 0,
        "warning": 0,
        "deprecated": 0,
        "error": 0

```

Options:
```bash
--filter=bot|utm|referrer|new|return

--preview=20
```


### visitor:metric

Internal system metrics from logs

Summarizes durations, memory, payload, response size, errors, and performance.

```bash
bin/console visitor:metric --from=-7days
```

Great for: performance profiling and trend detection.


### visitor:trend
